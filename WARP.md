# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository overview
- The repository currently contains only `README.md`, which declares the project name: `cs-innovators`.
- There is no application source code, package manifest, or build/test tooling configured yet.

## Commands
At this time there are no project-specific commands for building, linting, or running tests because no language- or framework-specific configuration files are present.

When additional tooling is added (for example, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, a solution file, or similar), prefer the commands documented there (e.g., npm/yarn/pnpm scripts, Python `make` targets, or test runner invocations) and update this section with:
- How to build or run the project
- How to run the full test suite
- How to run a single test or a focused subset of tests

## Architecture and structure
There is not yet any application code or directory structure to document. Once source files are added, summarize here the high-level architecture that spans multiple modules or directories (for example, how front-end, back-end, or shared libraries are organized and how they interact) rather than listing every file.
